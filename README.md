"# Garden_Automate_dotnet_react" 

This project is still in active construction. The link between all the components have been speed tested from the base "dotnet new react" project but there is a lot of refactoring to be done.
Next steps:
- Refactore the dotnet project for the desired use case
- pull device state on page refresh
- Add logging (ideally with 2FA)
- Add scheduling features
- Add watering modulation with daily weather data
